# Progress log


## 2026-09-29 — Phase 1 start (commit 7b0a81b)

- **M1.1 done.** Root workspace (`Potts` + `lib/LocalMath` + `lib/CorePotts` and their test
  projects), one gitignored Manifest, `CLAUDE.md`. A clean clone instantiates and
  precompiles in 9 s (CorePotts 1.9 s).
- **M1.2 done.** LocalMath subtree, nested `[workspace]` removed; 1947/1947 tests pass in the
  workspace (`GROUP=LocalMath`, 2 min 19 s).
- **M1.3 imported, not built.** MakiePotts subtree is in `lib/MakiePotts`, outside the
  workspace until M2.10 (it depends on the legacy Potts API).
- **M1.4 mostly done.** CorePotts is rewritten from FusedCPM against INTERNALS §1: 7763/7763
  tests pass in 5 s. `DEIntegrator{Alg,false,S,Int}` subtyping works. Still open: JET/AllocCheck
  gates.
- **Bugs found and fixed while testing:**
  - `shift`, `coordinates` and `color_site` boxed a captured variable reassigned inside an
    `ntuple` closure, costing 157 KB per MCS. The rule is now in CLAUDE.md.
  - The checkerboard colour vector was abstractly typed (`Vector{Color}`), so every launch
    dispatched dynamically.
  - Claim-buffer parity reset to buffer 1 every MCS. With an odd colour count the first
    colour used an uncleared buffer, which silently caused spurious claim losses. A
    regression test now covers it.
  - `Metropolis()` stored a Float64 offset, which is invalid IR on Metal. The default is
    now exact `0`, and float offsets are stored as Float32 on non-CPU backends
    (`_device_law`).
- **Warm throughput**, Graner–Glazier 256², 8 threads, M1 Pro:

  | Algorithm | Backend | MCS/s | ns/attempt | alloc/MCS |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | Sequential | CPU | 450 | 33.8 | 0 |
  | Checkerboard | CPU | 620 | 24.6 | 57–60 KB (KA launches) |
  | Checkerboard | Metal (Float32) | 1670 | 9.1 | 58 KB, launch-bound at this size |

- **Next:** M1.4 JET/AllocCheck gates, M1.4b transition-matrix oracle, M1.5 benchmark suite
  and `reference/` environment (CI parts deferred: local only).
