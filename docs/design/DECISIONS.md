# Decision log

Append-only. Each entry: context → decision → consequence. New questions during the
rewrite are answered here by the implementer using the principles in `AUTONOMY.md`,
not by asking the maintainer, unless the question is in the escalation list.

## D-001 Rewrite, not migrate (2026-09-29)
Context: 60k of 90k lines slated for deletion; branches diverged in those files.
Decision: greenfield monorepo; LocalMath and MakiePotts imported with history; frozen
`origin/main` set as scientific reference. Consequence: no conflict resolution in legacy
compiler/execution code.

## D-002 Monorepo home
Decision: `Potts.jl` on GitHub becomes the monorepo (in place). During the rewrite all
work lands on branch `monorepo`; `main` is untouched until cut-over. Legacy history
reachable via `legacy/*` tags. Other repos archived read-only after cut-over.

## D-003 Compatibility break
Decision: pre-migration trajectories and checkpoints match statistically, not bitwise.
Versions: Potts 0.4.0, CorePotts 0.3.0, LocalMath 0.3.0, MakiePotts 0.4.0,
PottsModels 0.2.0.

## D-004 Package names
Decision: keep LocalMath, CorePotts, Potts, MakiePotts, PottsModels. No renames.

## D-005 RNG
Decision: Philox4x32-10, 64-bit key from (seed, replica, repeat), 128-bit counter
(mcs, phase_round, entity, stream|draw). Streams assigned by codegen from namespaced
operation keys. Rationale: 32-bit multiplies are native on all GPUs; address semantics
preserved.

## D-006 Deterministic acceptance across backends
Decision: package-owned pure-Julia `exp` (no fast-math) in Metropolis; bitwise CPU/GPU
parity for the same scalar type is a tested guarantee. Base `exp` may be selected by
`fast_math = true` (opt-in, parity not guaranteed).

## D-007 Scalar types
Decision: `Float64` default on CPU, `Float32` default on GPU, `scalar_type` keyword
overrides. Parity claims are per scalar type.

## D-008 Checkerboard coloring
Decision: stride `s = max_read_radius + 1` per axis from footprint analysis (Moore
contact → 4 colors in 2D, not 9). Conflict rule: mutual-maxima cell claims. Dynamics
difference from sequential documented; sequential is the fidelity reference.

## D-009 Default algorithm
Decision: `SequentialCPM` default on CPU; `CheckerboardCPM` required on GPU. `solve`
without an algorithm on a GPU backend errors with a message naming `CheckerboardCPM`.

## D-010 Failure semantics
Decision: device status word + `ReturnCode.Failure`; phases validate before writing so
the last MCS boundary is consistent. No per-color shadow copies, no receipts.

## D-011 Lifecycle gating
Decision: device-side candidate count; all lifecycle kernels early-exit on zero. No
host sync per MCS.

## D-012 Parameters
Decision: `PottsParameters{T,NT,D,C}` (tunable `NTuple{NT,T}`, discrete, constant).
Structural parameters are literals in generated code; changing them rebuilds the
problem.

## D-013 State layout
Decision: structure-of-arrays `CPMState` with `NamedTuple`s keyed by model names.
Cell capacity grows by host reallocation at MCS boundaries.

## D-014 Codegen mechanism
Decision: Symbolics `toexpr` + custom lowering rules for Potts primitives (gathers,
trackers, draws, CSR reads), assembled into one `Expr` per generated function, compiled
via RuntimeGeneratedFunction + `drop_expr`. `eval_expression`/`eval_module` and
`expression = Val(true)` supported as in MTK. `cse = true` default.

## D-015 Symbolic front end dependency
Decision: ModelingToolkitBase (not full ModelingToolkit) in Potts; full MTK,
MethodOfLines, Unitful, Metal, CUDA as extensions.

## D-016 Fingerprint
Decision: one `UInt64` fingerprint = hash(generated code strings, structural parameters,
lattice, scalar type). Used only for checkpoint compatibility.

## D-017 Native components
Decision: init-once integrators coupled via SII; per-cell ODEs batched; Metal via
`EnsembleGPUKernel`. Scheduling phases kept.

## D-018 MakiePotts
Decision: stays `lib/MakiePotts`; reads through public accessors; gains `plot(sol)`.
Its `SPLIT_PROVENANCE.md` and render-frame contract are kept.

## D-019 Testing tools
Decision: ParallelTestRunner with `GROUP` (Core, QA, GPU, Reference); Aqua,
ExplicitImports, JET, AllocCheck in QA; Downgrade CI; AirspeedVelocity for benchmarks;
JuliaFormatter `style = "sciml"`.

## D-020 GPU testing
Decision: the GPU group runs locally (Metal) before every merge, by the implementer;
hosted GPU CI is a later addition and not a blocker.

## D-021 Reference environment
Decision: `reference/Project.toml` + committed `reference/Manifest.toml` pin the legacy
set (LocalMath 041b930, CorePotts 6ec7316, Potts 427dc2e2, PottsModels de97149,
MakiePotts a8a025f) by git revision. The only committed Manifest. Reference tests run
in the `Reference` group only.

## D-022 Parity dispute rule
Decision: if the new implementation disagrees with the reference beyond statistical
tolerance, the brute-force oracle decides. If the oracle sides with the new code, the
discrepancy is recorded here with evidence and the reference is marked wrong for that
observable. If the oracle sides with the reference, the new code is a bug.

## D-023 Talks and studies
Decision: SCDPotts, LocalMathSCD, SCDslides move to a separate `PottsStudies` git
repository pinned to the reference set; not part of the monorepo. KaimonCompilerTools
stays standalone.

## D-024 Legacy repos and branches
Decision: after tags are pushed, archived branches are deleted locally and remotely and
stale worktrees pruned. Legacy repos are archived on GitHub after cut-over.

## D-025 What must never happen without the maintainer
- force-pushing or rewriting `main` of any repository (cut-over is the one planned
  instance, and it is pre-authorized only when AUTONOMY.md's cut-over checklist passes)
- deleting a GitHub repository
- changing scientific semantics of a published model beyond D-003/D-008 without a
  decision entry citing the oracle evidence
