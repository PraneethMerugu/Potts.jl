    GranerGlazier(; name, lattice = (72, 72), λ, V₀, T, J)

Cell sorting by differential adhesion (Graner & Glazier, Phys. Rev. Lett. 69, 2013, 1992):
two cell kinds with an area constraint and kind-dependent contact energies on a periodic
lattice with Moore contacts. The defaults are the paper's (PRL p. 2015): `J_dd = 2`,
`J_dl = 11`, `J_ll = 14`, `J_cM = 16`, `λ = 1`, `V₀ = 40`, `T = 10`. They satisfy its sorting
hierarchy `J_dd < (J_dd + J_ll)/2 < J_dl < J_ll < J_M` (PRL Eq. 3), and light cells engulf
the dark ones.

Differences from the paper (Glazier & Graner, Phys. Rev. E 47, 2128, 1993):
- one MCS here is `N` copy attempts, the paper's is `16N`, so paper time `t` is ours `16t`;
- the paper copies from the 8 neighbours: solve with `SequentialCPM(; proposal = Moore(1))`
  (the algorithm default is `VonNeumann(1)`);
- 64 cells on a 72² torus (`graner_glazier_state`), against about 1000 in the paper, whose
  statistics are also taken after 2 MCS of T = 0 annealing on a copy.
